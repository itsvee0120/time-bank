## Get started

**Houreum** is a mobile-first community skill-sharing application built with React Native and Expo. It operates on the principle of a time bank, where the currency is time itself. Users can offer their skills and time to help others in the community and, in return, earn time credits that they can spend on services they need.

- **Task Management**: Keep track of your posted tasks ("My Requests") and the tasks you've committed to ("Current Requests").
- **Secure Time Reporting**: A simple and fair system for workers to report hours and for task owners to approve them, ensuring balances are updated correctly.
- **Push Notifications**: Stay updated with real-time alerts for task assignments, completions, and other important events.
- **Community Safety**: Features to report suspicious activity and bugs, helping to maintain a safe and functional platform.
- **Open Source**: The entire codebase is open for a transparent, community-driven development process.
